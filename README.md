# Artificial Intelligence -A* for solving a maze

Implement the A* algorithm to find an exit out of a maze. Your goal is to return the instructions for
solving the maze and show the configuration after each move. The maze is a rectangular grid containing passageways, walls, and a
single exit point that the agent must reach. The agent can move in four directions, but cannot move to a location containing a wall.
The agentâ€™s position can wrap-around, meaning that if the agent is in the leftmost location and the rightmost location of the same
row is not a wall, then the agent can still move left.
